TwitterPad allows twitter users to automatically collect tweets using custom search strings which are added to a specified page

== Description ==

TwitterPad is an automatic RSS-to-page plugin designed to integrate with [twitter](http://twitter.com). This plugin allows the user to add a number of custom search strings from [search.twitter.com](http://search.twitter.com) specifying which page new tweets should be added to. 

For example, using 'from:{yourtwittername} #tp' I can collect all of my tweets which have been tagged #tp. You are also not just limited to collecting your own tweets, any search string will work.   

The plugin was designed to automatically collect tweets I wanted to save for future reference (a tweet pad) and the page you collect tweets to doesn't have to be public. The plugin allows you to update any page in your blog, even if it is private.

Tweets are collected once a day the newest appears to the top of the page. [Here is an example of TwitterPad in use](http://www.rsc-ne-scotland.org.uk/mashe/googlewavetips/).
