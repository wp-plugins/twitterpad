TwitterPad allows twitter users to automatically collect tweets using custom search strings which are added to a specified page or as a new blog post

== Description ==

TwitterPad is an automatic RSS-to-page/post plugin designed to integrate with [twitter](http://twitter.com). This plugin allows the user to add a number of custom search strings from [search.twitter.com](http://search.twitter.com) specifying which page (or a new post) new tweets should be added to. 

For example, using 'from:{yourtwittername} #tp' I can collect all of my tweets which have been tagged #tp. You are also not just limited to collecting your own tweets, any search string will work.   

The plugin was designed to automatically collect tweets I wanted to save for future reference (a tweet pad) and the page you collect tweets to doesn't have to be public. The plugin allows you to update any page in your blog, even if it is private.

Tweets are by default automatically collected once a day the newest appears to the top of the page. There is an option to update more often if required. [Here is an example of TwitterPad in use](http://www.rsc-ne-scotland.org.uk/mashe/googlewavetips/).

**NEW** - TwitterPad v1.3 now has the option of digesting tweets as a new post. 

**NEW** - TwitterPad v1.3.1 now has the option of manipulating twitter RSS feeds with other services like Yahoo Pipes.
